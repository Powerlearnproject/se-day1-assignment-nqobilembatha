Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintaining software systems to ensure reliability, efficiency, and scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering(1968): the NATO Conference introduced software engineering to address the 'software crisis' where projects were really unreliable.
Rise of Object-Oriented Programming(1980s): Object-Oriented Programming was adopted to improve software design by organizing code into reusable objects.
Agile Milestone(2001): the Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible approach to software development, replacing rigid methods like Waterfall.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: defining the project's goals,scope and feasibility, and estimating the costs with resources required to establish a plan.
Testing: looking for flaws and deficiencies in the software and fixing all the problems until the software meets original requirements using automation and manual testing to analyze bugs.
Deployment: moving the software from testing environment to the operating environment and ensuring that the software complies with all the intial specifications.
Maintenance: managing problems that occurs in the live software environment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a structured, step-by-step approach, making it suitable for projects with clear and stable requirements, while the Agile methodology focuses on flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative improvements, making it ideal for dynamic and evolving projects. Both methodologies aim to deliver high-quality software, require planning, development, testing, and deployment,and have structured workflows to manage project progress.
â€¯A scenario for Waterfall: A government agency is developing a new tax filing system. The project has strict regulations, fixed requirements, and a clear timeline. Since changes are unlikely, Waterfall ensures all phases (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) are completed in order before launch. 
A scenario for  Agile: A startup is creating a mobile app for food delivery. Since customer needs and market trends may change, Agile allows the team to develop and release features in short sprints. They gather user feedback after each iteration and adjust the app accordingly to improve functionality and experience.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code, ensuring software functionality and performance. 
QA Engineer: Tests software for bugs, ensures quality standards, and collaborates with developers to fix issues. 
Project Manager: Plans, organizes, and oversees the project, ensuring timely delivery and team coordination. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs streamline the software development process by providing tools for coding, debugging, and testing in a single interface. They increase developer productivity by offering features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and integrated debugging. 
Example: Visual Studio is an IDE that supports multiple languages, offers debugging tools, and integrates with version control systems, making development more efficient. 
VCS track and manage changes to the codebase, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts. They ensure that code history is preserved, making it easier to roll back changes and collaborate.
Example: Git is a popular VCS that enables developers to manage code versions, collaborate on branches, and merge changes seamlessly. GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates team collaboration.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and truobleshooting where they are required to identify and fix bugs especially in larger codebases, which can be time consuming and complex.
Time management whereby they have to do multiple tasks, meeting deadlines, while managing the great workload.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The practice of designing and refining inputs or propmts given to AI models to elicit the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses.
prompt engineering is important in interacting with AI models because it enhances the effictiveness of AI models by optimizing inputs to generate accurate, relevant, and efficient outputs. Also improves user experience and ensures better AI perfomance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about space"
Improved Prompt: " Describe how planets are arranged in space relative to the sun"
The improved prompt includes a detailed explaination of what is required.
